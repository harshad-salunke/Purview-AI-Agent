Prompt for “Data Product Agent” Page (with mock JSON simulation)

Create a modern, professional "Data Product Agent" page for an enterprise data governance platform (Purview-inspired).

Add this page to the main navigation bar.

This page should simulate end-to-end data product discovery and visualization using mock data, no backend needed.

🏗️ Layout Flow:

Label: “Select Collection Framework”

Mock values: Finance Framework, Marketing Framework, Sales Framework

Once selected, show a generated list of data products below.

📄 Data Product Detail Page (Use Mock JSON Below)

Use the following mock JSON to populate UI fields:

{
  "dataProductId": "DP-001",
  "dataProductName": "Sales Performance Insights",
  "importance": "High",
  "curationDetails": {
    "description": "This data product provides unified visibility into regional and product-wise sales performance, combining transactional and CRM data.",
    "businessValue": "Helps leadership understand revenue trends, identify top-performing regions, and optimize sales strategy.",
    "curator": "AI Data Product Agent",
    "lastCuratedOn": "2025-11-05",
    "status": "Auto-curated and validated"
  },
  "datasets": [
    {
      "datasetId": "DS-101",
      "datasetName": "Sales_Transactions_2025",
      "records": 123456,
      "owner": "FinanceDept",
      "lastRefreshed": "2025-11-04"
    },
    {
      "datasetId": "DS-102",
      "datasetName": "CRM_Leads_Data",
      "records": 78234,
      "owner": "MarketingDept",
      "lastRefreshed": "2025-11-03"
    }
  ],
  "lineage": {
    "nodes": [
      { "id": "CRM_Leads_Data", "type": "Source", "x": 100, "y": 100 },
      { "id": "Sales_Transactions_2025", "type": "Source", "x": 100, "y": 300 },
      { "id": "Sales_Performance_Insights", "type": "DataProduct", "x": 400, "y": 200 },
      { "id": "Dashboard_PowerBI", "type": "Consumer", "x": 700, "y": 200 }
    ],
    "edges": [
      { "source": "CRM_Leads_Data", "target": "Sales_Performance_Insights" },
      { "source": "Sales_Transactions_2025", "target": "Sales_Performance_Insights" },
      { "source": "Sales_Performance_Insights", "target": "Dashboard_PowerBI" }
    ]
  }
}

🧩 UI Requirements:

Tabs: Dataset | Lineage

Dataset Tab: show dataset cards (name, records, owner, refresh date, “View Dataset” button).

Lineage Tab: render an interactive lineage graph using mock data above.

Allow zoom, pan, and tooltip on hover (show node type).

Add “Fit to Screen” and “Download as Image” buttons.

All data is mocked — simulate async loading (e.g., 1s delay).

Use TailwindCSS + React + shadcn/ui + recharts or react-flow for visuals.

Style should match Microsoft Purview-like professional design with rounded cards, Fluent colors, and responsive layout.
