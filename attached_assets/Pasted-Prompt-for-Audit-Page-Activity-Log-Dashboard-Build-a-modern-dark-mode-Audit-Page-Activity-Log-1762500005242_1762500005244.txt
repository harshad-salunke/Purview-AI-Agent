Prompt for “Audit Page” (Activity Log Dashboard)

Build a modern, dark-mode Audit Page (Activity Log Dashboard) for a custom Microsoft Purview-like governance portal.

This page should display all user and system-level activities — such as curation, updates, approvals, data product changes, agent interactions, and recommendations fixed — using mock data.

🗂️ Page Layout:

Title: Audit & Activity Logs

Top Section (Filters):

Date range picker (From – To)

Dropdown filters:

User / Agent (e.g., “Admin”, “Data Curator Agent”, “Information Agent”)

Action Type (e.g., “Create”, “Update”, “Approve”, “Delete”, “Curate”)

Asset Type (e.g., “Dataset”, “Data Product”, “Collection”, “Recommendation”)

Search bar (for filtering by asset name or ID)

“Export Logs” button (mock, not functional yet)

📋 Audit Table / Activity Feed:

Use a clean table or timeline-style view with following columns:

Timestamp	User / Agent	Action	Target Asset	Details	Status
2025-11-06 10:42 AM	Data Curator Agent	Curated	Sales_Transactions_2025	Schema standardized	✅ Success
2025-11-06 09:15 AM	Admin	Approved	CRM_Leads_Data	Metadata approved	🟢 Completed
2025-11-05 08:32 PM	Information Agent	Fetched Info	Finance_Dataset_2024	Read metadata details	🔵 Info
2025-11-05 07:45 PM	Harshad	Updated	Data Product: Sales Insights	Updated lineage connection	🟠 Modified
2025-11-04 02:15 PM	AI Recommendation Agent	Suggested Fix	Unassigned Collections	Missing RBAC roles	🟡 Suggested

🎨 UI Requirements:

Use dark mode with accent colors (Azure blue + neon green highlights).

Cards or table rows should have subtle hover effects and smooth transitions.

Include icon indicators for each action type (🧩 Create, 🖋️ Update, ✅ Approve, 🧠 Curate, 💡 Suggest).

Add a right-side drawer: When a user clicks a log entry, open a detail view showing:

User/Agent info

Asset details (name, type)

Full change summary (diff or textual)

JSON of metadata change (mock)

Option to “Revert” or “Acknowledge” (mock action)

Add pagination (10–20 logs per page)

Simulate async loading (1s delay)

Built using React + TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui + React Table or TanStack Table

🧩 Bonus Feature Suggestions:

Toggle between Table View and Timeline View

Export audit logs (mock CSV)

Filter by “AI vs Human” actions

AI Summary Banner: “Most recent changes: 5 curated, 2 approved, 1 reverted today.”
