Project Context:
We are building a custom Agentic AI Portal for Microsoft Purview — a modern, intelligent web interface that allows users to interact with AI agents for information retrieval, data curation, and recommendations.
The frontend should be implemented with mock data only (no real backend yet) and showcase chat simulation, UI flow, and interactions.
Use a dark mode, modern design, and a left navigation sidebar.


---

🧭 Navigation Layout

Left Sidebar Menu:

1. 💬 Chat (Agent Interaction)


2. 💡 Recommendations


3. 🗂️ Data Assets (optional future feature)


4. ⚙️ Settings (optional — theme toggle, user profile)




---

💬 1. Chat Page (Main AI Interaction Page)

🔹 Purpose

This page simulates an intelligent chat between the user and Purview AI agents (e.g., Information Agent, Data Curator Agent).

🔹 Layout and Components

Chat area: scrollable vertical feed showing alternating user/system messages.

Input area (bottom sticky):

Agent selection dropdown (default: “Information Agent”).

Above the input box, show the selected agent name.

When user types @, show autosuggestions of data assets (mock list like SalesDB, CustomerInfo, FinanceData, HRRecords).

Add file upload button beside input (for uploading data).

Add send icon (paper plane) for sending messages.


Chat history section (left collapsible panel):

Show list of previous chat sessions with timestamp and agent context.

Click to reload a past conversation.

🧠 Chat Simulation Behavior (Use Mock Data)

The chat UI should simulate a real conversation.
When user types specific phrases, show pre-defined responses from mock data.

Example simulated inputs and responses:

User Input	Mock System Response

"Give me asset related to sales"	Show a vertical card list of mock data assets like: <br>1️⃣ SalesDB (Owner: Raj, Collection: Finance)<br>2️⃣ Sales_Transactions_2024 (Owner: Priya, Collection: Retail)<br>3️⃣ Sales_Analytics_Report (Owner: Arun, Collection: BI)<br>Each card should have “➡️ View More” button that opens a detail page.
"Curate @SalesDB"	Show curation card with editable metadata fields: Description, Owner, Sensitivity Label, Classification. Include ✅ Approve and ❌ Cancel buttons. On Approve, show success toast “Data asset successfully curated!”
"Show metadata of @CustomerInfo"	Open a detail modal with metadata (mock JSON view or formatted table).
"List all unassigned assets"	Show table or list of assets missing owner info.
"Recommend me data products"	Redirect or show short preview link to “Recommendations” page.


Chat should include mock typing animation and delayed responses to mimic real AI conversation.

Include a small animated agent avatar beside system responses.



---

🗂️ Data Asset Detail View

Shown when user clicks “View More” on any asset card.

Show detailed metadata (mock fields like: Name, Type, Owner, Collection, Created Date, Sensitivity, etc.).

If editable (curation flow), allow inline edits with Approve/Cancel buttons.



---

💡 2. Recommendations Page

🔹 Purpose

Displays AI-driven recommendations related to Purview governance, ownership, or quality.

🔹 UI Components

Header: “Purview Recommendations”

Cards or List Items for each recommendation:

Title (e.g., “Unassigned Data Owners”)

Priority (High 🔴, Medium 🟠, Low 🟢)

Description

“Fix” button



🔹 Mock Recommendations

Title	Priority	Description	Fix Action

“Data assets with no owner assigned”	High	5 assets don’t have an owner	Opens modal with asset list and mock “Assign Owner” button
“Collections missing RBAC roles”	Medium	2 collections lack role configuration	Shows RBAC details
“Data products not yet created”	Low	3 eligible assets can form data products	Opens mock form


🔹 Extra Features

Filter by priority level (dropdown).

Badge counts by priority.

Smooth modal for viewing recommendation details.



---

🌙 3. General UI Design Requirements

Dark Mode UI (default)

Accent color: Azure Blue or Electric Teal

Rounded cards, subtle shadows, smooth hover effects

Use modern component library (Tailwind + Shadcn UI or Material UI)

Responsive layout (desktop-first)

Smooth transition between pages



---

⚙️ Technical Setup for Vibe

Use React or Next.js.

Maintain mock data JSONs for:

Include dummy delay or typing indicator for realism.



---

🧠 Example User Flow

1. User opens portal → lands on Chat Page.


2. Selects “Information Agent”.


3. Types: “Give me asset related to sales” → sees mock asset cards.


4. Clicks “View More” → opens asset detail.


5. Switches agent to “Data Curator Agent”.


6. Types: “Curate @SalesDB” → sees editable curation card.


7. Approves → gets success toast.


8. Navigates to Recommendations Page → sees mock Purview issues with fix actions.

Modern dark-mode UI

Left sidebar navigation

Interactive chat simulation with @mentions and agent selection

Data asset card/detail views

Editable curation cards

Recommendation management page with fix actions

Smooth transitions and realistic AI-like behavior

Note :  for select agent show some recommendations questions sould be asked so it's helpful  for simulation. And also created this new page Page Overview

Page Name: Asset Detail Page
Purpose:
To display a single data asset’s full metadata, lineage summary, ownership, quality, and governance information in a visually appealing, structured, and editable format.

⚙️ Data Setup (Mock JSON Example)

{
  "id": "asset_001",
  "name": "Sales_Transactions_2024",
  "type": "Database",
  "collection": "Retail",
  "owner": "Priya Sharma",
  "status": "Pending Review",
  "description": "Contains 2024 sales transaction records for retail stores.",
  "sensitivityLabel": "Confidential",
  "classification": "Finance Data",
  "createdDate": "2024-02-15",

Use this JSON as mock input for rendering UI.


---

🧠 Interactions

Show editable fields in Overview, Business Metadata, and Quality tabs.

Implement mock Save (Approve) and Cancel.

On Save: show success toast and refresh view.

On navigation from chat (e.g., when user clicks “View More”), this page should open dynamically with mock data passed as route param (e.g., /asset/:id).



---

🪄 Optional Enhancements

Add breadcrumb navigation → Home / Chat / Sales_Transactions_2024

Include search within page for metadata fields.

Add “AI Suggestions” box (mock text like “Consider adding classification for this data asset”).

Add a small activity timeline showing who updated the asset last.

Recommendation Details Page

Purpose:
This page opens when a user clicks on any recommendation item (like “Unassigned Data Owner” or “Uncurated Assets”) from the Recommendation Page. It should display all data assets that fall under that recommendation with an option to view or fix them.


---

🧩 UI Requirements:

1. Header Section

Page title: “Recommendation Details”

Subheading showing which recommendation the user clicked (e.g., “Uncurated Data Assets”).

A “Back” button to go back to the Recommendation list.



2. Filter Bar

Search bar to filter assets by name or tag.

Dropdowns for:

Importance (High / Medium / Low)

Status (Pending / Fixed)

Quick Summary or Description

View More or Fix button




4. Fix Functionality Simulation

When the user clicks Fix, show a modal dialog or side panel that allows:

Changing importance or status

“Save Fix” and “Cancel” buttons


Once “Save Fix” is clicked, update the card status to Fixed (simulate the backend).



5. Optional Additions
